<p>The rules governing the play of Chance-it are described below.</p>

<ol>
<li>    A game of Chance-it involves two players. The player with the highest total score after all rounds is the winner.</li>
<li>    For this program, you are to have the computer act as player 2 and you are player 1. Also, for this program a game will consist of 10 rounds.</li>
<li>    During a round, each player takes a turn, resulting in a score for each player for the round.</li>
<li>    A turn for a player consists of rolling the dice one or more times. After each roll, the player must decide whether to take the value of that roll or Chance-it in hopes of getting a higher roll.</li>
<li>    If a player decides to stop, then their turn ends and their score for that turn is the value of their last roll.</li>
<li>    If, in re-rolling, a player rolls any previous roll of this turn, then their turn ends and their score for this turn is zero..</li>
</ol>
