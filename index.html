<p>Chance-It is a simple turn-based, dice roll game written primarily in Javascript and JQuery consisting of 2 players, the interactive human player and a computer that uses a predetermined algorithm. The objective of the game is to accrue the highest score between the two players.</p>

<a id="rules" class="anchor" href="#rules" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rules</h3>

<p>The rules governing the play of Chance-it are described below.</p>

<ol>
<li>    A game of Chance-it involves two players. The player with the highest total score after all rounds is the winner.</li>
<li>    For this program, you are to have the computer act as player 2 and you are player 1. Also, for this program a game will consist of 10 rounds.</li>
<li>    During a round, each player takes a turn, resulting in a score for each player for the round.</li>
<li>    A turn for a player consists of rolling the dice one or more times. After each roll, the player must decide whether to take the value of that roll or Chance-it in hopes of getting a higher roll.</li>
<li>    If a player decides to stop, then their turn ends and their score for that turn is the value of their last roll.</li>
<li>    If, in re-rolling, a player rolls any previous roll of this turn, then their turn ends and their score for this turn is zero.</li>
</ol>

<a id="technical-details" class="anchor" href="#technical-details" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Details</h3>

<p>The human player initially enters a seed for a pseudorandom number generator to function properly. Afterwards, the game begins and can escalate to a maximum of 10 rounds, though the player has the option to quit at any time. Once the game begins, the player rolls two pairs of dice, generating a minimum and maximum value of 1 and 12, respectively. After any given roll, the player has the option to "CHANCE-IT", effectively, re-rolling their pair of dice for a potentially higher score. The player has the option to do this repeat this continuously until they are content OR if they land on the same value as any of the previous rolls, immediately ending their turn and setting their score to be 0 for that turn.</p>

<p>After the human player generates a score for their turn, the computer makes a similar decision. The computer rolls their pair of dice and determines whether or not to "CHANCE-IT" based on three probability algorithms. Once both players have received a score for a turn, the round counter is incremented and the human player has the option to continue playing or quitting the game.</p>
